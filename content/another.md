When you head there, be prepared to see Bonelli’s eagles, Great Spotted Cuckooherons, sea otters, among many others. In September/October there’s always the Birdwatching Festival in Sagres, that we usually attend with guests.

 Besides being one of the most beautiful places to visit in Algarve, there’s a history behind. Before people understand that the world was round they thought that the Cape St. Vincent was “the end of the world”.
